# CNN
convulational nueral network course is best taught by Andrew Ng in his course in deeplearning.ai
He explan very clearly about the course and the fundamental of the CNN.

you can also follow the tensorflow video made by one googler which is made available by the deeplearning.ai

It mainly focuses on the implementation part of the CNN.
If you are into the application part of the CNN then just for it.

If you want to practise the application part of the CNN then go for the colab given by google or jupyter notebook.

once done with the CNN go for the YOLO v3 for better understanding.

Follow the coursera standford Machine learning course for getting the basic knowledge.

In the coming year it will be among the most developed technology.
